Hi there! Below are the coding interview tasks for the web development position. Please follow the instructions carefully to complete the tasks.

## Task Description

### Initial Setup
- Clone the repository to get started.
- Navigate to the root directory of the project with `cd web-dev-interview`.
- Start the application with `./vendor/bin/sail up`.
- Run the database migrations with `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.
- The above command would create a `products` table and seed it with 100 fake products.

### Laravel Task
- Create a new route at `/laravel_interview`.
- On this route, display a list of the fake products seeded into our database in the preceding step. The following product attributes should be displayed: `name`, `image`, `amount`, `created_at`.
- The list can be displayed as a table, a simple list, or a grid.
- The list should be sortable based on the following product attributes: `name`, `price`, `created_at`.
- The list should be paginated, allowing the user to choose how many products to display per page. Additionally, there should be page buttons at the bottom of the list to traverse the collection of products.
- On this route, display a form at the bottom of the list for adding products to the list of products. This form should have the following fields:- `name`, `image`, `price`, `created_at`.

### React Task
- Create a new route at `/react_interview`.
- On this route, repeat the tasks listed in the Laravel task, but this time, use a React app mounted on the `/react_interview` route you've created.

### Submission
- Do not push your work to the `main` branch.
- Create a new branch named after yourself. For example, if your name is John Smith, create a branch called `john_smith`.
- Push your work to the branch named after yourself for review.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
